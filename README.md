# Contact Management System

## Project Overview

The **Contact Management System** is a simple console-based Java application that allows users to manage and organize their contacts. This application allows users to:

- **Add new contacts** with their name, phone number, and email address.
- **View all stored contacts** in a user-friendly format.
- **Search for contacts** by name.

This project utilizes Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and Java's `ArrayList` to store and manage contact data. It's designed to be a basic, text-based contact manager that runs in the terminal, and it provides a good introduction to working with Java and GitHub.

## Features

- **Add Contact**: Allows users to input new contact information.
- **View All Contacts**: Displays a list of all contacts stored in the system.
- **Search Contact**: Allows users to search for a specific contact by name.
- **Basic File-Based Persistence**: (Optional) Can be extended to save contacts to a file.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The programming language used to build the application.
- **ArrayList**: Used for storing contact objects in memory.
- **Console I/O**: User interaction is done through the command-line interface (CLI).
